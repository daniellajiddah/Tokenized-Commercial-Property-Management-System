# Tokenized Commercial Property Management

## Overview

This platform leverages blockchain technology to create a transparent, efficient, and decentralized system for commercial property management. By implementing smart contracts for property verification, tenant management, maintenance coordination, and expense allocation, we enable fractional ownership of commercial real estate while streamlining operations and reducing administrative overhead.

## Key Components

### Property Verification Contract
Validates ownership and condition of commercial properties:
- Ownership record verification

- Title and encumbrance validation
- Asset tokenization and fractionalization

### Tenant Management Contract
Handles lease agreements and relationships:
- Digital lease execution and storage
- Automated rent collection and distribution
- Tenant onboarding and verification
- Occupancy tracking and reporting
- Lease renewal and termination protocols

### Maintenance Coordination Contract
Tracks repair requests and service completions:
- Maintenance ticket creation and routing
- Vendor verification and management
- Work order tracking and completion verification

- Service quality assessment

### Expense Allocation Contract
Distributes costs among property owners:
- Proportional expense calculation
